I am pleased to share that I have been selected to participate in the **[CSH Winter School 2026](https://csh.ac.at/education/winterschool/)** hosted by the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna, Austria. The program, titled *Rethinking Human Capital: The Past and Future of Work*, will take place from April 13--17, 2026.

## About the Program

The Winter School brings together an outstanding group of faculty and researchers to explore how AI and technological change are reshaping tasks, skills, labor markets, and employment patterns. Participants will work with online job postings, GitHub repositories, and historical datasets using computational methods including NLP, network analysis, and economic complexity tools.

**Program Directors:** Frank Neffke, Ljubica Nedelkoska, Xiangnan Feng, and Hillary Vipond.

**Guest Faculty:** James Evans (University of Chicago), Tom Kemeny (University of Toronto), Maria del Rio Chanona (University College London), Johannes Wachs (Corvinus University Budapest), and Liuhuaying Yang (CSH).

## Connection to My Research

The Winter School's themes are closely aligned with my current research on AI exposure and employment dynamics in the Indian labour market (*Canaries in the Code?*), which examines how AI-related technological change affects employment outcomes in a developing country context. I look forward to engaging with complexity economics methods and building on the skill relatedness and task-based frameworks developed by the program's directors.
