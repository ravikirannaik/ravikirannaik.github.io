##### Abstract

This paper examines changes in AI-exposed employment in India using three rounds of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (2017--18, 2022--23, 2024; N = 1,268,400) linked to the Anthropic Economic Index. Entry-level workers (ages 22--25) in AI-exposed occupations -- software developers and database professionals -- are growing as a share of employment, in contrast to the 13 percent decline reported for comparable US workers. The task composition of India's IT sector is being restructured: routine technical support collapsed from 25 to 2 percent of IT employment while software development rose from 39 to 60 percent and data entry emerged as a new entry-level pathway. The nominal wage premium for AI-exposed occupations expanded, driven primarily by falling non-canary wages rather than rising canary wages. These patterns are consistent with an open-economy mechanism in which AI adoption abroad generates demand for Indian workers who build AI systems -- a "trade-shock reversal" that simultaneously draws women into technical careers.
