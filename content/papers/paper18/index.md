##### Abstract

This paper examines the scoring effects of two T20 cricket rule innovations -- the IPL Impact Player substitution (introduced 2023) and the BBL Power Surge floating powerplay (introduced 2020) -- using interrupted time series and difference-in-differences methods. Drawing on ball-by-ball data from 1,169 IPL and 662 BBL matches, we find that the Impact Player rule raised total runs by an estimated 12.9--21.6 runs per match, with the frequency of 200-plus innings increasing significantly. A DiD specification with CPL/PSL controls confirms the finding (+12.9 runs, p = 0.043) with no pre-trends. The BBL Power Surge shows no aggregate scoring effect, suggesting redistribution rather than inflation of runs across match phases. Neither rule affects competitive balance as measured by win margins.
