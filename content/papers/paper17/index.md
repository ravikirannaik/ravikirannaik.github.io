##### Abstract

How does households' position in the income distribution shape institutional trust and political participation in India? Using panel data from the India Human Development Survey (2004--05 and 2011--12) with household fixed-effects -- to our knowledge the first application of within-household estimation to the inequality-trust-participation nexus in a developing democracy -- we find that relative income position predicts institutional trust erosion in both rural and urban settings, independently of district-level development. Lower institutional trust corresponds to distinct participation patterns: low-trust households show reduced voting and panchayat engagement but increased membership in civic organisations where civil society density is high. Rural-urban differences reveal that trust erosion links more strongly to disengagement in rural areas, while urban contexts show greater redirection toward non-institutional participation.
