##### Abstract

This paper examines how workers exercise agency and organize geographies of resistance within global AI production networks. It investigates the intersection of algorithmic management, worker autonomy, and spatial dimensions of labor resistance in the context of AI-driven production systems, analyzing how workers in diverse geographic locations navigate and contest the power dynamics embedded in AI-mediated work arrangements.
