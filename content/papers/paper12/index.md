##### Abstract

This paper examines inter-generational economic mobility and transmission mechanisms in India. Drawing on the author's doctoral research on intergenerational economic mobility during 1945--1990, the study investigates the extent to which economic status is transmitted across generations and the institutional channels through which this transmission occurs in the Indian context.
