##### Abstract

This paper investigates the role of assortative marriages in the intergenerational transmission of education and economic status in India. Since family background plays a primary role in the intergenerational transmission process, how families get formed has implications for persistence within and across social groups. Positive assortative marriages tend to reinforce the association between generations whereas negative assortative marriages weaken it. The paper analyses how marriage patterns -- shaped by India's caste system and evolving marriage institutions -- contribute to the reproduction of inequality across generations and the extent to which marital sorting amplifies or dampens intergenerational mobility.
