##### Abstract

This paper examines the heterogeneity of labour on digital platforms in India. It analyzes how different platform types -- delivery, transport, and service platforms -- create varied labor market conditions and employment outcomes for workers. The study provides evidence on the diverse nature of platform work, challenging the monolithic treatment of gig workers in policy discussions.
