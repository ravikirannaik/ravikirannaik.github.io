##### Abstract

This chapter examines gender differences in returns to education mismatch in India, analyzing how the misalignment between educational qualifications and occupational requirements affects men and women differently in the labor market. The study contributes to understanding gender-based disparities in labor market outcomes, particularly in the context of developing economies where educational credentials may poorly signal actual capabilities.
