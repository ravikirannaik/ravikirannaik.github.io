##### Abstract

The precarity literature on digital labour platforms argues that algorithmic controls and ratings discipline workers through task allocation, forcing longer hours and reduced earnings. We argue that platform work may instead provide greater market access and clients, and not all workers face a downward cycle. Using primary survey data on 2,000+ workers across delivery, transport, and service platforms in India, we examine how skill specialisation and platform heterogeneity shape earning differentials. Workers may select into platform work expecting increased market access and consequently increased earnings.
