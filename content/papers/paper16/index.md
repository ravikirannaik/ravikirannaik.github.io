##### Abstract

How do different award institutions define cinematic excellence? At the Academy Awards, 93% of Best Picture winners also received a screenplay nomination, suggesting that peer-voted systems treat narrative quality as near-necessary for the highest honour. We test whether this screenplay--Best Film nexus extends to Indian cinema by comparing two institutionally distinct award systems: the Filmfare Awards (hybrid: 50% expert jury, 50% popular vote) and the National Film Awards (NFA; 100% government-appointed expert jury). Using newly compiled screenplay co-award data and logistic regression on 689 films (1954--2025), we find a striking gradient: the screenplay--Best Film overlap falls from 93% at the Oscars to 47% at Filmfare to 13--17% at the NFA. Star presence carries a significant negative association at Filmfare but not at the NFA. These findings suggest that voting architecture -- not merely evaluative taste -- shapes what counts as the "best" film.
