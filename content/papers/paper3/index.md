##### Abstract

This paper examines the relationship between human development and disaster mortality in India. Using data across Indian states, the study demonstrates how variations in human development indices correlate with differential mortality outcomes from natural disasters. The findings highlight the protective role of development investments in reducing vulnerability to disaster-related deaths.
