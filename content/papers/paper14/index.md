##### Abstract

Research on labour market disparities has made significant contributions across various fields, yet the application of occupational prestige analysis to stratification economics in developing countries remains virtually unexplored. This study extends the stratification economics framework to the Indian context, where the caste system represents perhaps history's most explicit occupational prestige hierarchy. Using nationally representative data on wage employees from India's Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2023--24 (N = 72,071), we construct an India-specific Prestige Index (INPI) and analyse occupational prestige differentials by caste, gender, religion, and rural-urban location. Scheduled Castes face the largest differential (-3.81 prestige points), followed by Scheduled Tribes (-3.16) and OBCs (-2.21). Women experience substantial prestige differentials (-4.03 points). Urban labour markets are associated with larger caste and gender differentials -- a phenomenon we term *stratified modernisation*.
